# FirstCNNModel
So, this was my first experiment with convolutional neural networks and I have to say, I really enjoyed it! As a beginner in machine learning, I tried my best to do as much as I could on my own, but as I am still learning, I found that some tutorials were really helpful in figuring out how to make this model.

Basically, what this code does is train a convolutional neural network on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model learns to classify images of different objects into one of ten categories, such as "airplane", "bird", "cat", and so on.

During training, the code prints out the loss at regular intervals so that you can monitor how well the model is learning. Once training is complete, the code evaluates the accuracy of the model on a separate test set, and prints out the overall accuracy as well as the accuracy for each individual category.

What I need to work on: I still think that I need to practice more with convolutional neural networks and potentially make another model soon, trying to rely less on external sources for information.

Overall, I learned a lot from this project and I'm excited to keep exploring and learning more about machine learning!
